## CTIS Tease Viewer

Black is a image slideshow program for a NSFW game called Custom Tease Instructor. Black is a card viewer and generator for so called 'CTIS' or 'CTI Script' cards, which execute small non-complex code when drawn.

## Introduction to Custom Tease Instructor
If you're not aware of what CTI is you can look it up on it's most official website [here](https://www.cti-community.net). Please note that opening this website whilst at work may raise some eyebrows, and definitely not your paycheck.

## Installation
Black can be installed by downloading the latest binary file from the 'releases' page.

## Creating cards
Information on how to create cards and parameters for doing so are found in the wiki section of this repository. Any help can be found by asking on the CTI [forums](https://www.cti-community.net/forum).
